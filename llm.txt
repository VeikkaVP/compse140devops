In this exercise LLM (ChatGPT) was used to parse the output json since my host system is widely used for other stuff on top of this course (linux). This resulted in some of the outputs mainly df -h returning large numbers of lines which were hard to differentiate on the terminal line from possible error messages. ChatGPT was quite helpful in parsing the contents of the json response message as I was unable to make the code make it look good. It gave me a good idea of what the output really was and allowed me to reflect on them to write my findings.txt file. On the other hand when I tried to ask the LLM how to make the output better apart from parsing the uptime result it suggested hardcoding the responses in the code as "they are the same every time on this host system". This was a clear shortcoming when using LLM to help change code based on the output of it.
